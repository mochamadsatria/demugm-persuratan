### Known-Bug

1. When packaged with `pkg`, the next.js cannot running with error message: `Cannot load next.config.js`. I am currently ignore this because this is just one day project requested by a friend. If you have the solution for this, please make an issue so i can learn the way it's done.

2. When the program run with `node server.js` all system work but the next/router doesn't. Idk what make this too, so all the command use `npm run`.
